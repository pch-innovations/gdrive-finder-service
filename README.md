# gdrive-finder-service
MacOS service to extend the context menu in Finder in order to add convenience functions to Google Drive managed folders

## What does this do

At its current stage it:

- Adds the context menu item `Copy GDrive link` to your Finder
    - This copies a modified path to your clipboard that looks like `gdrive://CloudStorage/GDrive-yourgoogleacount/yourfile`
- Handles the app url scheme `gdrive://` to open links generated by this servie
    - The service will turn the link back to a local path, based on the domain of your google accounts.

This basically allows you to share local GDrive links with your coworkers who have access to the same shared files.



## Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/pch-innovations/gdrive-finder-service/releases) `google-drive-finder.pkg`
2. Right click -> Open (not signed)
3. Follow installer instructions

## Usage

### Sharing a link

1. Navigate to a shared google drive folder or file in your Finder
2. Right-click -> Services -> Copy GDrive link
    - This will copy the link to your clipboard
    - Sometimes its not under "Services" but directly in the menu
3. Share the link with your coworkers (e.g. on Slack)

### Opening a link

1. Just click on a "gdrive://" link you shared or have received
    - Tell Slack the first time to always open gdrive links with the app
2. Your Finder will navigate to the shared file if it can access it on your computer


## Building it from source

1. Build in Xcode
2. Archive .app and put in `/Applications` folder

### Development

- To test just run the project from Xcode and watch the console while opening or generating links
- If you want to refresh the Finder services context menu run
 ```sh
 /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
 ```


## Creating installer

1. In Xcode go to Product > Archive > Distribute App > Copy App
2. Archive the app under the name `gdrive-finder-service` at `./Installer/`
3. Run `./Installer/create_packge`
    - This will package whatever .app bundle is at `./Installer/gdrive-finder-service/gdrive-finder-service.app`
    - Additionally it bundles the `Installer/scripts/postinstall`
4. Find the installer package at `Installer/output/gdrive-finder-service.pgk`


## Further info

- Everything interesting happens in `gdrive-share/AppDelegate.swift`
- `func application(...)` is the entry point for clicking on a `gdrive://` link
- `func handleFileService(...)` is the entry point for clicking on the `Copy GDrive link` context menu item
    - Configured in `gdrive-share/Info.plist`
- `func applicationDidFinishLaunching(...)` sets up an auto-terminate after 5 seconds to close the app automatically when it has been opened by the postinstall script
    - The postinstall script opens the app once to register the service items with MacOS
